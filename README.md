# nearest-tens

 Description
This Java program takes an integer input from the user and finds the nearest number **divisible by 10** that is **less than or equal to** the given number.

## 🧠 How It Works
- The user is prompted to enter a number.
- The program loops from 1 to the entered number.
- During the loop, it checks if each number is divisible by 10 (`i % 10 == 0`).
- It stores the last such number in a variable.
- Finally, it prints the nearest tens value.

## 💻 Sample Output
Enter the number to find out the nearest divisible 10 : 47
40

# 🛠 Technologies Used
